## Final project

### Data
The data used for the first part of the analysis were those published by Rochette et al. (2017) These constitute three RADseq lines using the restriction enzyme SbfI. For the second part of the analysis (graphical observation of the variants), I used a subset of data from Rochette et al. (2017), which was only 1 of the three available lines. In the `data` folder is the file` n_sps_per_locus.tsv` which was used to make the graphs.


### Meta
In the `meta` folder is a` tsv` file containing the provenance of each sample.

### Bin
Finally, there are two scripts in the `bin` folder. The first (`Script1.sh`) is the procedure for downloading the sequences and observing their quality. The second (`Script2.Rmd`) shows the commands to display the number of loci and snps with the variation of parameter n = 1-3, keeping M = 2 and m = 3.

### Análisis 
Data analysis is found in [Discussion](Discussion.md)
